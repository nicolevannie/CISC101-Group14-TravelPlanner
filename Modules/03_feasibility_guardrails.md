Module 3 — Feasibility & Guardrails 
Change Log (2025-11-15): Added daily budget consistency check to flag days that exceed user’s maximum spend. 

Apply internal if/else logic for realism and problem-solving: 
- If venue closed → replace with indoor option nearby.
- If restaurant over budget → switch to cheaper similar one.
- If activities too far → select nearer or add transit.
- If rainy/cold season → include at least one indoor backup.
- If total time too long → shorten or simplify.
- If mobility limits → add rest breaks and step-free venues.
- If dietary restriction → ensure compliance.
- If bookings needed → mention under Quick Checks only.


- **If total estimated cost for a single day exceeds the user’s specified daily budget → mark the day as “Over Budget” and automatically generate lower-cost alternatives (free museums, parks, local markets, public transit instead of taxis).**
